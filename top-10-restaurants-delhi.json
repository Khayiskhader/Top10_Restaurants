      "We ordered galoti kabab, butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, dal makhani, paneer butter masala with naan. Out of these, kabab and butter chicken were the best and perfectly cooked. The rest were good too but these two stood out.\n\nThe service could be better. We were 5 people but when we started giving our order the waiter kept asking us to order less in a tone that was little rude and she was insisting it again and again which got irritating after a point. I understand that it is their job to help us with the quantity but she could have been a little more polite.\n\nI wanted to give 5 star to the place but because of the staff behaviour and service experience I am giving it 3 stars.",
      "Non vegetarian dishes are excellent in this restaurant. They have different self service sections for kabaab, gravy, breads etc. Table service is also available in 2.0 section and advisable for the new comers though little costlier than the self service section. ‚ôøÔ∏è‚ùå",
      "It's very good Dhaba but if you will sit in restaurants of this Dhaba you will feel disappointed as we ordered fish curry which was simply prepared in the gravy of chicken masala\nBut the dal makhani tawa fish with vegetables are my favourite dishes here\nOverall very good"

At the end of the meal the head chef came out and talked to us and answered any questions we had. Truly an amazing experience and I would 100% recommend this place. If I'm ever in deli again I will visit this place for sure.",

      "The high price is for the Ambiance and of course curated dishes. But if you go on weekends then the service is in confusion. So go on a week day to enjoy the service also.\n\nThe drinks were nice. But the food portions are small so order accordingly. I ordered a Chicken soup which was too pungent to drink ‚Ä¶. Had to leave it. The pasta was nice and also the chicken dish. A place for a one time visit.",
      "Amazing ambience and a plethora of specially curated dishes. The service is superb and the staff is courteous and prompt.\n\nWe went over a weekend so there a lot & lot of crowd. The staff were on their toes, smiling and attending to the guests.\n\nWould suggest all to go on a weekday.\n\nThe drinks were nice and the food portions are good too.\n\nWe ordered a veg mezze ü´í platter and a pizza. The platter was good but the pizza was amazing. Thin crust with juicy tomatoes.\n\nMocktails are amazing too\n\nMust visit\n\nLocated almost opposite to Qutub Minar"

      "Excessively Priced!!\nNot an authentic Japanese restaurant, they serve fusion food. The udon noodles tastes more like an Indian Chinese dish. The grilled prawns consists of just 3 pcs of prawns split open and served shelled with some seasoning.\n\nThey have lot of vegetarian options and some selected non vegetarian food.\n\nThe dishes are priced very high and the portions meagre (we left feeling hungry !!).",
      "Authentic Japanese doesn't get better than this.\n\nInside the Leela ,the place oozes of japanese autheticity from moment you walk in. The glass budha statue right in the middle of the dinning area the place adds a soothing touch to whole experience.\n\nWith alcohol  from all parts of japan and world there something for everyone.\n\nWe started with Tuna Tataki as cold appetizers and Megu's Shrimpop as hot appetizers.  Tuna tataki was amazing the shrimpop were just ok.\n\nNext on the table prawn nilgiri sushi roll, it was one of the best we ever had, in mains we ordered Grilled Prawn and grilled baby chicken. chicken we found to be on the sweeter end of the spectrum.\n\nThe highlight of the day was the Azuki Almond crumble tart, just amazing and should never be missed\n\nA definite recommendation for japanese/Asian fine dine for your special occasions.",
      "We ordered 4 items out of which only yellowtail sushi roll was fine. Their salmon grilled which cost 2.7 k comes with just a tiny 4 piece and it was stale one. Once we cut it open, we can get that strong rotten smell. Their chicken yakitori is just a tiny 6 piece of normal fried chicken which we can get anywhere. Their chicken fried rice is a burnt rice which was very bitter when eat. The ambience and service is good. But i dont recommend to anyone. Im wondering how come they receive many awards. Must involve some politics maybe or paying people to vote for them. All the dishes they serve have no specialty. Just normal dish you can get evrywhere in delhi. And yeah you wont get full after you spend 6.5 k also because its very tiny amount of wahtever they serve. So think it nicely"

      "I am giving overall 3 star rating due to below reasons\n1. They force you to go for fixed menu, instead of ala carte so that they can generate maximum revenue per table. This is enethical practice, we should have an option to select either options as they are provided by restaurant.\n2. The service is very slow, it takes multiple reminders and followup to order drinks and other things. If u r charging and exorbitant money (around 10k per person), u should deploy a dedicated waiter per table.\n3. The sitting arrangement is very uncomfortable, they gave stools and benches. Moreover they have literally placed a table and chair in every possible space available. One of our guest was not able to even sit properly because his knees were touching the table due to less space.\n3. Some of the good items are average, like mutton raan, which is part of fixed menu. If u ask them to replace it with some other mutton items, they charge extra for that. Since u r charging 8k plus taxes already for fixed non veg menu, why u don't give options to choose the dishes, specially they are part of your fixed menu.\n\nThey god fame and and now they are misusing that market position in order to maximise their revenue, while completely ignoring the customer care and sevice. You can't run such business just on the fame for long time.",
      "An Unforgettable Culinary Experience!\nBukhara is truly a gem when it comes to North Indian cuisine. From the moment you walk in, the rustic yet elegant decor sets the tone for an authentic dining experience. The ambiance is warm and inviting, with traditional seating and beautiful copper cutlery that enhances the cultural vibe.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî rich, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Each dish felt like it had a story to tell. The service was impeccable too; the staff was courteous, knowledgeable, and ensured that every need was met promptly.\n\nThough it‚Äôs on the premium side (‚Çπ2000+), the quality, presentation, and experience make it completely worth it.

Served with a fresh, aromatic coriander chutney, each bite was bursting with flavor. For the main course, we ordered saag paneer, butter chicken, wok-fried rice, lachha paratha, and tandoori rotis. Every dish was beautifully presented, generously portioned, and packed with rich, balanced flavors.

But alas, like a hero in a drama, it went through a rough patch. The food lost its magic, service slowed to a snail‚Äôs pace, and the whole vibe felt like a ghost town. Needs a background music üé∂\n\nBut guess what? On my latest visit with my daughter, I spotted a shining light at the end of the tunnel. Could AnnaMaya be making a comeback? Spoiler alert: yes!\n\nWe kicked off with the vegetarian dumpling soup, which was pretty good (not blowing any minds, but comforting enough).\n\nThen came the main event: dal Makhani, rice, and butter garlic naan. Now, the naan was a little chewy‚Äîprobably schuld to the maida‚Äîbut the dal Makhani? Absolute knockout! So authentic and delicious, it brought a tear to my eye.\n\nNow, here‚Äôs the real plot twist: the service! It wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù It was back to that warm, attentive vibe from the glory days. Special shout out to Shubham, who, when the kitchen was out of masala chai (the horror!), personally brewed a fresh cup just for me. And Himanshu, our server, kept everything running smoothly.\n\nOnly hitch? The food took some time to arrive. But hey, I‚Äôm choosing to believe it‚Äôs because everything was made fresh and with love.\n\nSo, cheers to AnnaMaya‚Äôs comeback! May the dal flow forever, and the service keep shining bright.

Whichever you pick, the star is the same incredible, time-tested food. Ambience differs, but the iconic taste remains consistently fantastic.",

The Paneer Butter Masala and Kadhai Paneer were perfectly cooked with creamy and spicy gravies that paired well with the naans.\n\nI also tried their Paneer Tikka. It was decent in taste with a good quantity and soft paneer, though I felt it could have been slightly better in terms of flavour punch. Still, it was enjoyable.\n\nThe service was good, staff were polite and quick, and the atmosphere was vibrant and traditional, giving an old Delhi charm. Overall, it‚Äôs a very good restaurant with the best food quality in Chandni Chowk for North Indian cuisine. It may not feel luxurious but it delivers great value for money with filling portions and authentic taste.\n\nDefinitely a must-try if you want to experience Delhi‚Äôs famous Punjabi food with a homely touch.
